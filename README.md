# Smart Grid Attack Detection using Machine Learning

Detects false data injection attacks in Smart Grid systems using ML models:
- Perceptron
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Project Structure
- `SmartGridAttack.py`: Tkinter GUI for dataset upload, training, and attack detection
- `Dataset.csv`: Training data
- `testData.csv`: Test data
- `features.png`: Feature diagram
- `Documentation.pdf` / `final doc.docx`: Full project report

## Run Instructions
1. Ensure Python is installed
2. Install required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run: `python SmartGridAttack.py`

Built with ðŸ’¡ scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and Tkinter.
